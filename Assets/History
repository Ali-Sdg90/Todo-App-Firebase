STEP 3 :
This program was written on November 24, 2021, and I planned a writing marathon challenge for myself.
I wrote in 4 hours from 6 pm to 10 pm, and the next day I made some small corrections.
It is the first program that I recorded completely and time-lapsed :)

STEP 4:
Step 4 code started during my university semester 4 exams and I spent 8 days on it from Jan 17, 2023 to Jan 25, 2023. During this time, 
I got to know ChatGPT and I got help from it for the README, it's really awesome!
The situation in Iran is awful, and a proposal was approved to add the IRGC to the list of terrorists in Europe...
Life is really hard here, I hope you are in a better situation when you are reading this...

STEP 5:
We should have added knockout.js and MVVM to the todo app. Knockout.js is very interesting, but you have to approach it differently to do anything. From one perspective, updating the site becomes easy, but coding it is hard, and it can really melt your brain...
The situation in Iran is worse than before. The dollar has hit an unprecedented record of 60 tomans, and every day there is news of high school girls being poisoned... It's very scary, very, very scary.
Two days ago, finally after 231 days, I had my CS interview. I hope everything goes well...
Last time, I wished that when you read this next time, things would be better. It didn't happen for me, but I hope it happened for you :)

STEP 6:
Today is September 8, 2023. Yes, I am in a CS internship for six months. I've grown so much during this time. I fell in "love" and my heart broke hard. I experienced deep pain, more pain than I have ever experienced before. Now, I think I am kinda okay. In these six months, I started learning React, and I've finished it for now. I really love React, and I've done some awesome projects with it. During these six months, I've been watching CS mentoring videos, and they've changed my personality. I'm really glad that I started the CS internship course. Now, I'm an intern mentor and have been working at MelkRadar for about six weeks. It is so cool, and I enjoy working for a professional company.

The situation in Iran is stable. It's like a fire under the ice. People are poorer than the previous day. Two to three weeks from now is Mahsa Amini's death anniversary year. I really can't handle pressure like last year. We are tired from fighting with the stupid dictatorship...

Saba has finished her Konkoor with a ranking of 201. I am really happy for her.

I've had an interesting time with too many ups and downs. I hope that when you read this, you have a healed soul and a stable, happy mood. I hope you are in a better situation and free of pain. Good luck, and keep FIGHTING. :)
